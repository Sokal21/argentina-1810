"""Put motion capture onto a Tripo rig by its bones' turns, twist and all: for a roll, a fall, a
blow, where copying only which way each bone points (tools/blender/retarget_bvh.py) loses the
twisting that makes it look alive.

    Blender -b --python tools/blender/retarget_rot.py -- RIG.glb CLIP.(fbx|bvh) OUT.glb --name rodada [--frames 10:40] [--ground] [--gait]

Reads Mixamo's FBX (mixamorig:Hips...) or CMU's BVH (Hips, LeftUpLeg...).

How: both skeletons are brought to one pose of reference first, the captured one's own rest (a T
for both Mixamo and CMU), the rig's by turning each of its bones to point the way the captured
one's does at rest (its arms go up from Tripo's A). Then for every frame each captured bone's turn
from its rest is given to the matching bone of the rig, from its reference; the hips also rise and
fall, scaled to the rig's legs. Played in place: what the capture travels, the game does. With
--ground the body is rested on the ground every frame, its lowest point touching it (a roll);
with --feet the lowest heel or toe is (anything on its feet: the scabbard hangs low enough to
take the ground from --ground).
