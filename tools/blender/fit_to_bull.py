"""A model of ours (Tripo's, unrigged) put on the skeleton of one of Quaternius's animals (CC0): the ox on
the bull, the nahuel (a puma) on the wolf. Written for the ox on Quaternius's bull's skeleton, to play the bull's own
clips as they are: carried over onto Tripo's quadruped rig, the walk came out strange however it was
mended (its hind legs never bent as a cow's). The bull's bones are moved into the ox's body, its skin
bound to them by Blender, and its clips kept untouched: they are turns of those same bones.

    Blender -b --python tools/blender/fit_to_bull.py -- OX.glb BULL.fbx OUT.glb [--still Ear,Tail] [--hips yes] [--even yes]

- The ox is turned to look as the bull does (along -Y, its left at +X) and sized to the bull's length,
  its feet on the ground.
- The bull's bones are stretched to the ox's box; then every joint of a leg below the belly is moved
  across and along to the middle of the ox's leg at that height, so each bone lies inside its leg.
- The skin is weighed by heat on a copy with its doubled vertices merged (Tripo doubles them along its
  texture's seams: weighed apart, the skin cracks open there), given back from the copy's nearest;
  small loose pieces (horns, eyes) go whole with the nearest of the body.
- Its tail's bones are laid down the ox's own tail, its middle found at each height.
- Only the bones' keys are kept in the clips (each also keys the whole armature, in the FBX's units).
OUT goes to prepare_rigged.py (front +z: it looks along glTF's +Z already).
