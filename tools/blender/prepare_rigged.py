"""Make a rigged, animated model ready for the 3D game, in Blender without a window.

    Blender -b --python tools/blender/prepare_rigged.py -- OUT.glb MAIN.glb [MORE.glb ...] [--front +z] [--colors 16] [--texture 512] [--carries sabre]

Tripo gives each batch of animations as a whole model of its own, the same skeleton in each. This
keeps MAIN's skeleton and mesh, takes every animation out of all of them (by its own name, which
Tripo gives the preset's: idle, run, slash...), and drops the rest, including the stray sphere
Tripo leaves in its files.

- Turns the skeleton so the model's front looks along +Z (glTF's forward). Say which way it
  looks as given with --front: a rigged model from Tripo looks along glTF +Z already.
- Feet at the origin and one unit tall in its rest pose: the game grows it to its drawn height.
- Flattens the texture as tools/blender/flatten.py does.
- Gives it what it carries (--carries, from props.py, comma separated), held by its bone.
- Exports one GLB with every animation as its own clip.
