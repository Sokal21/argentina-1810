"""Stand a captured upper body on another clip's legs: the spine, and everything on it (neck, head,
arms), from CLIP; the hips and legs from BASE, looped under it. For a capture whose actor does the
right thing lying down (Mixamo's Laying Severe Cough, the plague-dead soldier's retching): turned
from his hips, his back curls and his arms move as they did, over a standing man's legs.

    Blender -b --python tools/blender/upper_from.py -- CLIP.glb BASE.glb OUT.glb [--name vomito] [--lean 0] [--frames 0:40]

CLIP.glb and BASE.glb are single clips of one rig (tools/blender/retarget_rot.py's). --lean bends
him forward that many degrees more at the first bone of the spine, on top of the capture's own;
--frames takes only that stretch of CLIP.
