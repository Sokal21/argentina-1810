"""A clip mirrored, left for right: the captain fires his pistol with his left hand, his sabre in his
right, and the capture (Mixamo's Handgun) fires with the right.

    Blender -b --python tools/blender/mirror_clip.py -- RIG.glb CLIP.glb OUT.glb [--name NAME]

CLIP is a clip already on his rig (tools/blender/retarget_rot.py). Every frame, each bone is posed as
the mirror image of its fellow on the other side (L_ for R_; a bone of the middle, its own), across
the plane between his shoulders: its frame in the armature reflected, then set right again by the
one fixed turn that takes the fellow's rest to its own, so the result is a turn, not a reflection.
