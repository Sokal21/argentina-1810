"""Cut a turnaround sheet into one square picture per view, for image-to-3D.

    python3 tools/cut_turnaround.py SHEET OUT_PREFIX NAME...

The sheet shows one figure per view, side by side on a plain background (taken from its top-left
corner). Each view is cut by its connected parts, not by straight lines: a hand of one figure and
the sabre of the next can share columns. Every part goes to the figure whose middle it is nearest,
so a sabre that came loose from its owner still goes with him. Each view is saved as
OUT_PREFIX_NAME.png, centred on a square of the same background.
